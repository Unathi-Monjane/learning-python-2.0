# 🛒 Python Shopping Cart Project

Welcome to my **Python Shopping Cart** project!  
This project is part of my ongoing journey to learn and practice Python programming in 2025.

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a simple console-based application that simulates a **shopping cart system**. It allows users to:
- Add food products and their prices.
- Continuously input new items.
- View the total cost.
- Exit the program when done.

It's designed to help reinforce:
- Python variables
- Loops
- Conditionals
- User input
- Data structures (like dictionaries or lists)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Working with `while` loops for continuous input
- Using dictionaries/lists to store and manage cart items
- Handling user input and converting data types
- Applying conditionals to manage flow (e.g., exit conditions)

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a product name and price.
2. The product is added to a shopping cart.
3. The loop continues until the user types `'done'` or `'exit'`.
4. The program then displays the list of products and the total cost.

## 💻 Example

Enter product name: Bread
Enter product price: 15
Enter product name: Milk
Enter product price: 25
Enter product name: done

🛍️ Shopping Cart:

Bread: R15.00

Milk: R25.00
Total: R40.00


## 📁 Files

- `shopping_cart.py`: Main Python script containing the logic.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add option to remove items from the cart
- Add quantity input and item update feature
- Build a basic GUI version using Tkinter

## 📚 Status

✅ Completed basic version  
🔄 Continuously improving as I learn more
